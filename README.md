**Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 3:**

Welcome to my submission for Task 3 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. In this task, I have built a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

**Objective:**
The goal is to analyze marketing data and train a machine learning model that predicts if a customer will subscribe to a term deposit, based on attributes like job, marital status, age, previous contact, etc.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used for this task is the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
