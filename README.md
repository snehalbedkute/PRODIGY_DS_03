**Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 3:**

Welcome to my submission for Task 3 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. In this task, I have built a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

**Objective:**
The goal is to analyze marketing data and train a machine learning model that predicts if a customer will subscribe to a term deposit, based on attributes like job, marital status, age, previous contact, etc.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used for this task is the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

**Tools and Libraries Used:**
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib & Seaborn

Project Overview:
The dataset was first preprocessed to handle categorical variables and missing values.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand the distribution and correlations of features.A Decision Tree Classifier was trained using the processed dataset.The model was evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.Feature importance was visualized to understand which attributes influenced the modelâ€™s predictions most.
